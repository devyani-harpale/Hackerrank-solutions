'''Let's learn some new Python concepts! You have to generate a list of the first N fibonacci numbers, () being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.
Concept
The map () function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables.
Let's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.
>> print (list (map (len, ['Tina', 'Raj', 'Tom'])))
[4, 3, 3]
Lambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function. In simple words, it is a function that has only one line in its body. It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.
>> sum = lambda a, b, c a + b + c
>> sum(1, 2, 3)

Note:
Lambda functions cannot use the return statement and can only have a single expression. Unlike def, which creates a function and assigns it a name, lambda creates a function and returns the function itself. Lambda can be used inside lists and dictionaries.
Input Format
One line of input: an integer N.
Constraints
0 <= N <= 15
Output Format
A list on a single line containing the cubes of the first V fibonacci numbers.
Sample Input
5
Sample Output
[0, 1, 1, 8, 27]'''

cube = lambda x: x*x*x # complete the lambda function 

def fibonacci(n):
    # return a list of fibonacci numbers
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for num in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-2] + fib_sequence[-1])
    return fib_sequence
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    print(list(map(cube, fibonacci(n))))
