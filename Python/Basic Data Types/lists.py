'''Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
2. print: Print the list.
3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
4. append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
5. sort: Sort the list.
6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
7. reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
Example
N = 4
append 1
append 2
insert 13
print
append 1: Append 1 to the list, arr = [1].
append 2: Append 2 to the list, arr = [1,2].
insert 1 3: Insert 3 at index 1, arr = [1,3,2].
print: Print the array.
Output:
[1, 3, 2]
Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of commands.
Each line i of the subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.'''
